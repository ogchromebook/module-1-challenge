# SEO-Marketing-Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to update a preexisting webpage to be inline with current accessability standards.
This webpage solves any accessibility issues for users who are unable to view a .jpg file and has been updated to include alt text to explain what the webpage is displaying.
I learned that it is easier said than done to update non-semantic HTML to semantic HTML.
*Side note, I am fully aware this webpage is messy, as this is my first challenge I may have messed up some of the CSS source code that caused display errors to the final product*
